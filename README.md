# Detecting Machine Failures with Reinforcement Learning

## Running the code

This code requires Python3.10 to run.

During setup, you may encounter an issue where `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails due to
the `regressor` package. `pip install setuptools==57` then running the requirements.txt install
again should resolve the issue. 

Simply running each of the `x-run.sync.ipynb` will produce all of the desired results files.


## Notes
The `.sync.ipynb` and `.sync.py` files are the result of one of my vim plugins, but the notebooks
can be run normally.
